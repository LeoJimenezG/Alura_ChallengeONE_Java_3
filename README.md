# Alura_ChallengeONE_Java_3
Alura Challenge: Forum-Hub. Java BackEnd API REST

This API REST system simulates the functionality of a Forum using four main endpoints. It supports the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE http methods.

---

## üìò How does it work

- Every endpoint capable of returning an object response, it will return the status code and a json.
- The system uses PostgresSQL for the database.
- The url before the endpoints can be adjusted according to the needs. (e.g., `http:/anyserver/ENDPOINT`).
- The system has four main endpoints: **/login**, **/topic**, **/author** and **/answer**. Each one of them correspond to different aspects and will vary on the http methods allowed.

 ## üîê Security Considerations

- The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization.
- The token must be included in the `Authorization` header for all requests except the `/login` endpoint.
- Ensure secure storage of tokens on the client side.
